**In CMMN**, the complete behavior model of a Case is captured in a casePlanModel. A casePlanModel is depicted using a “Folder” shape that consists of a rectangle with an upper left smaller rectangle attached to it. The name of the Case can be enclosed into the upper left rectangle. The various elements of a casePlanModel are depicted within the boundary of the casePlanModel shape. Note that the casePlanModel is the outermost Stage that can be defined for a Case.

**In Cafienne**, you can create a Case in the Case Modeller by selecting Cases in the section CMMN Models and then in the section Create Model by entering a Name and a Model and next pushing the button Create or Create + Open. In the section CMMN Model/Cases the created Case is shown. By clicking on it, it will open on the Modelling Canvas. Then you can start adding Items to the Case Model, just by dragging icons of the items on the Canvas and using their Properties Palettes.

> The model, designed in the Cafienne Modeler, is deployed as `/.../target/definitions/....xml`.
