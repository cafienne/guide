We have prepared for you Cafienne Demo. 

Cafienne-demo contains [Cafienne Modeller](modelCases.md), the binaries of Cafienne including the [API](apiAuthentication.md). We, at SpronQ, consider this to be the core of Cafienne. With this core you can build real business applications.

Upon this core, we built [CafienneUI](CafienneUI.md). Using Cafienne UI you can build a user interface that helps demo-ing the application.

Cafienne UI goes with [two business applications](TwoApps.md) which show you how you can use the Modeller and the API.
