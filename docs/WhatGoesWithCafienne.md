If you want to be introduced how the engine interpretates the model, continue reading [Case Engine](http://localhost:3000/docs/cafienneEngine.html), if youw want to know how to use the Cafienne API, continue reading [Cafienne API](http://localhost:3000/docs/apiAuthentication.html). 

Cafienne is accompanied by Cafienne UI. This UI shows a business user all the cases and tasks that are assigned to him or her. Also, Cafienne UI provides a method to generate simple UI in which business users can execute their tasks. 

Therefore, you can use Cafienne UI to create a simple executing path for your case model. It then comprises simple user interfaces in which case workers can ccomplete tasks. In this way, Cafienne UI helps in the communication between IT, business analists and business people.
