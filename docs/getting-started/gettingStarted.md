Cafienne Demo is an environment that holds [two examples](genericUIExamples).

- Hello World
- Travel Request

The Helloworld example is nothing more than what is says. It does not really show the power of CMMN, but it is more of a simplistic application that demonstrates that the environment is up and running.

Travel Request shows a little more complex flow, including technical examples for sending emails, generating PDF documents and invoking REST services.

The demo environment consists of

- [Cafienne IDE](design-case), a place to model cases
- [Cafienne Engine](engine-overview), the heart of the system that executes case models (see the [REST API](api-overview)).
- [Generic UI](genericUI), providing a simple user interface that helps demostrating and debugging the flow of the case application.
