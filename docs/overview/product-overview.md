## Cafienne Engine
The heart of the product suite is formed by the [**Cafienne Engine**](/docs/engine/overview).
<br />
The engine interprets Case Models and runs on the powerful Akka runtime.

## Cafienne IDE
Case Models can be created through the [**Cafienne IDE**](/docs/ide/overview).
<br />
This is a simple, browser based environment that natively integrates with existing development tools.

## Cafienne UI
In many solutions a specific design of the user interface will fit the end user purpose best.
<br />
However, for the sake of fast prototyping and early usage feedback, Cafienne comes with a generic user interface that can interpret any design of case model.
<br />
The [**Cafienne UI**](/docs/getting-started/overview) shows a business user all cases and tasks assigned to him or her. Task forms can be quickly created through [React JSON Schema Forms](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form).
This makes it extremely easy to rapidly build complex demonstrations that show business users how the model gives them a solution to support their business process.
<br />
You can use Cafienne UI to create a simple executing path through the case model. It then comprises simple user interfaces in which case workers can complete tasks. In this way, Cafienne UI helps in the communication between IT, business analists and business people.
